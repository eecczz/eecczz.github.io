The simple yet clean textures applied to characters and buildings are a hallmark of Wii games. I identified the specific characteristics of these textures and implemented them using the Unity engine.

Characteristics of Wii textures:
- Simple colors and shading
- Low-gloss surfaces
- Thick cartoon-style outlines
- Smooth animated textures

Implemented in Unity:
- Used the Lit shader
- Set Smoothness to 0
- Set Metallic to 0 to remove metallic properties and gloss
- Recreated the Wiiâ€™s simple yet clean effects using the Emission property

This style uses straightforward and clean visuals, employing simple textures and shading that are optimized for hardware performance.
