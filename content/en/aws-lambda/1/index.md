To create a service like YouTube, not only must you be able to load numerous videos from storage, but users should also be able to adjust the quality of each video manually. Additionally, the service must be able to handle uploading and playing large videos. Since this cannot be achieved with the basic `video` tag in HTML, I used AWS Lambda to implement these features.
