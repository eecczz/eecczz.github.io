## Bio

I am currently an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Artificial Intelligence at Chonbuk National University. My main field of expertise is game development, and I have worked on several projects in this area, including the release of the game *Gone* as part of the *Coala* team from the Department of IT Information Engineering. In addition, I participated in a team project during my *Creative Engineering Design* course to develop a *Soulslike* game. On the side, I am individually developing a clone of the *Wii Swordplay* game.

I am also honing my web development skills by working on projects such as an online shopping mall system and a YouTube clone web service, gaining proficiency in *React* and *Spring Boot*. I have experience with various frameworks including *Unity*, *React*, and *Spring*, allowing me to quickly learn and adapt to new frameworks as needed. I also excel at project planning, having developed the ability to plan and execute long-term individual projects from scratch.
